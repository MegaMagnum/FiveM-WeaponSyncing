# FiveM-WeaponSyncing

 This script is made in Dutch because i made it for a Dutch FiveM server.

This script is not made for people that have zero knowledge of fivem development. 
I will be providing minimal support for people that need help.

**INSTALLATION**

 - Execute the .SQL file that is in the git
 - Drop the resource in your resource folder and restart your server
